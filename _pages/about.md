ðŸŽ“ I'd recently graduated from INSA Toulouse and INP-ENSEEIHT with a double diplome in Modelisation and Artificial Intelligence.

ðŸ§¬ I'm interested in the application of Maths and AI in biology and medical science.

ðŸ“š I'm currently seeking a thesis opportunity to pursue a doctorate.

# Selected Experience

## ðŸ’¼ Apprentice in Data Science at Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetics 

As part of my training, I completed a 2.5-year apprenticeship in Data Science at Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetics. This experience was incredibly enriching, providing me with numerous opportunities to learn and grow. In the final 6 months, I worked on the **OptiSen Project** ðŸ”¬, focusing on the prediction of consumer preferences and the sensory profiles of facial care products based on their formulations. Through this project, I applied cutting-edge methods, such as preditive models, explainable AI techniques, and developed practical tools to support product formulation.
