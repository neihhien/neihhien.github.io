🎓 I'd recently graduated from INSA Toulouse and INP-ENSEEIHT with a double diplome in Modelisation and Artificial Intelligence.

🧬 I'm interested in the application of Maths and AI in biology and medical science.

📚 I'm currently seeking a thesis opportunity to pursue a doctorate.

# Selected Experience

## 🧠 AIPau 2024 - Topic: Regconition and Classification Tables from PDF 

With my teammates from INSA, we participated in the contest AIPau. The topic chosen was an interesting problem that we can apply our skills combining:
- 🖼️ **Image Extraction** with **YOLOv5**
- 📝 **Text Extration** with **Transformer** 
- 🤖 **Text Classification** with **ML Model**

Two intensive weekend days were incredibly rewarding. Even that we didn't reach the final (we placed **2nd in our topic**), we learned many things - not only how to tackle on the real problem 🔍 but also how to manage the different tasks and team work 🤝.

# Professional Experience

## 💼 Apprentice in Data Science at Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetics 

As part of my training, I completed a 2.5-year apprenticeship in Data Science at Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetics. This experience was incredibly enriching, providing me with numerous opportunities to learn and grow. In the final 6 months, I worked on the **OptiSen Project** 🔬, focusing on the prediction of consumer preferences and the sensory profiles of facial care products based on their formulations. Through this project, I applied cutting-edge methods, such as ***preditive models***, ***explainable AI*** techniques, and developed practical tools to support product formulation. The project is an inovation for the formulation  by combining model interpretion and correlation analysis to
