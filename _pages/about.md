🎓 I'd recently graduated from INSA Toulouse and INP-ENSEEIHT with a double diplome in Modelisation and Artificial Intelligence.

🧬 I'm interested in the application of Maths and AI in biology and medical science.

📚 I'm currently seeking a thesis opportunity to pursue a doctorate.

# Selected Experience
<!--
## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers (Ongoing)

Interested by multimodal combining with the great curiousity about the application of multi-omics, I've started to conduct the project:

🧬 Multimodal AI in Bioinformatics (Multi-Omics + Clinical)

Paper: MOLI: Multi-omics Late Integration with Deep Neural Networks

Dataset: TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) – gene expression + clinical data

Project Idea:

- Reimplement the MOLI model to classify cancer types or predict survival.

- Use SHAP or Integrated Gradients for feature-level explanation.

<!-- Add a small dashboard to let users explore per-sample interpretability. -->

🔧 Tools: Python,TensorFlow, SHAP, mixOmics, TCGA datasets (via UCSC Xena)

## 🧠 AIPau 2024 - Topic: Regconition and Classification Tables from PDF 

With my teammates from INSA, we participated in the contest AIPau. The topic chosen was an interesting problem that we can apply our skills combining:
- 🖼️ **Image Extraction** with **YOLOv5**
- 📝 **Text Extration** with **TesseractOCR** 
- 🤖 **Text Classification** with **ML Model, Transformer (DistilBertForSequenceClassification)**

Two intensive weekend days were incredibly rewarding. Even that we didn't reach the final (we placed **2nd in our topic**), we learned many things - not only how to 🔍 tackle on the real problem from scratch but also how to manage the different tasks and team work 🤝.

# Professional Experience

## 💼 Apprentice in Data Science at Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetics 

As part of my training, I completed a 2.5-year apprenticeship in Data Science at Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetics. This experience was incredibly enriching, offering continuous opportunities to grow both technically and professionally.

During the final 6 months, I led work on the OptiSen Project 🔬 — focusing on the prediction of consumer preferences and sensory profiles of facial care products based on their chemical formulations.

In this project, I applied:

📈 **Predictive modeling** to map formulations to sensory profile and user appreciation

🧠 **Explainable AI techniques** (e.g., SHAP, LIME) for interpretability

🖥️ **User interface development** to support R&D teams in creating optimized formulations with better sensorial outcomes

This project helped bridge data science and product innovation, contributing to more informed and consumer-centric formulation processes.
